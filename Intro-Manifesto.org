* Parasite Suite – A set of musical installations about networked experience and computational aesthetics.


** TODO Introduction																									 :Edit:

Parasite Suite is a creative investigation sonicly orientated art projects can respond to current climates within digital technology. Each works is a meditation on inmplications of technology, of which I have focussed on two topics, networking and computation. These two processes determine much of what David Berry has termed, 'softwarized society'[fn:1].

My meditation on this topic is not a rejection or protest, rather an attempt to see how concepts that cause anxiety about the digitization of our world[fn:2],such as issues of 'digital anxiety' about topics such as surveillance and alienation, can have their heirachies and processes changed to give power to new actors and outcomes.

In this sense the work is inspired by coucpets such as 'sousveillance'[fn:3] where a technology is leveled against an oppressor rather than the opposite. In my course of exploring how to 'turn the tables' however, I have also found that it is often the composition of technologies and the relationships that their design encourages[fn:4], that require the formulation of organic and locally specific technologies that offer solutions more relevant in my case for an artistically inpired, more affecting outcome, and on a general level benefit participants.

However the process by which I developed this project was not from a carefully chosen theme, but rather a methodoology where I have sought to describe some of the 'back boxes' of communications that I interact with on a daily basis. My methodology for investigating something like data-collection, monitoring and signal intelligence is derived from creating a project that mimics a small subset of these behaviors in an uncommon context, and then noting the processes that are fundamental to the existence of the 'machine'. This method involves treating the world in a manner very simlar to the concept of a 'function', otherwise known as a subroutine in computer programming. In some way I am attempting to import concepts from a pradigm in computer programming, 'functional programming'

It just so happens that when I consider some of the inherant qualities of the manner in which I would conduct myself, even in moments that I step away from a 'screen', the encounters of my life are all deeply network driven.

If I was to describe a common daily schedule for the period over which I have been working on these projects, it would be a highly computational one.

There I will usually spend the first two hours reasearching, either reading books on a relevant topic or trying to follow any blog posts or online tutorials about the technical aspects of the 'black boxes' that are the technical building blocks of my projects.

** Networked Experience

My definition is an embodied process of understanding that takes place across a network. Some of the times one might typically include the remote administration of computers, multi-user collaboration on documents (as seen in services like google docs), or even on a  more basic level telecommunications services of all kinds that allow for two way interaction.

Here we notice that the technologies that *offer* networked experience as a technology are unlimited, but it is the situations in which it becomes a *practice* which are interestion to me. What defines the practice is the interaction of more than one participant and the aspect of message communication as a tool rather than crafting.

What I am particlarly interested in is mutual real-time meaning making between multiple particpants or kinds of actors.

** Inspirations

The inspiriation is taken from Serres concept of 'black boxing'. Seeing the world in terms of components. Taking one and stripping away layers of abstraction in order to understand the processes involved, then returning the 'box' to its position  with newfound understanding.

In my case I am looking at the current state of human relations as I experience them. I am particularly focussed on the 'machinic' qualities and the managemnt of what is commonly thought of as mediation, and common anxieties and concerns with current engagement. I am usingtools that seem applicable and the easiest and most relevant to the concerns. typically the same materials such as, web page scripting, electronic components and sensory inputs and outputs, that are involved in the 'black box'.

So while the work might seem at first technical in nature. I am more interested in trying to 'simply' understand a set of relations and use audio as a descriptive tool.


The four art installations I have assembled represent a set of considerations about how music and technology should interact, and of what this might mean for wider attitudes about the role of the computer in music and society at large.

*** TODO

It is my belief that the notion of the usefulness for the computer in exploring musical, social and political possibilities is surprisingly limited. The key area of limitation I wish to explore is in the area of networked interaction between multiple agents. The key theme is essentially how the 'social' can be introduced into artistic and compositional practice.

The inspirations for these works is drawn from histories of early electronic computing and cybernetic thought, as well as philosophical works about technology and communication. I wished to develop some knowledge of the history of cultural metaphors about computation and networking, as well as the history of 'what wasn't' in technology.[fn:9] By exploring other possibilities that may have been forgotten or ignored we can see interesting possibilities for restructuring engagements with networks and machines.

In particular I have focused on the act of surveillance, a term that I am trying to explore absent of its pejorative sense. This term represents a useful the union point between the machine and the network, and implies a model of engagement based up monitoring and responding to interactions in a dynamic manner. For my studies it has come to represent a point of coalescence between the anxieties of today and an area of early study in the field of cybernetics.

The notion of the responsive surveillant, who may take on any biological or material form, is one of the cornerstone ideas of the field of cybernetics. We can see this biologically influenced notion otherwise known as a feedback system everywhere from the thermostat to many of the software 'daemons' of computers that operate in the backhand of UNIX based computers.[fn:10]

In these early experiments with the idea of 'what a compute should be', we can see the possibilities and disappointments of concepts such as like 'Socialist Computing', and efforts to radically reconsider the function of the computer when it is relevant to the culture and philosophy of disparate groups.

Artistically a reconsideration of the manner in which we interact with computers and each other under the banner of surveillance also represents a sincere attempt to portray some of the radical possibilities of computer art when it embraces its lineage and explores the anxieties of the present.

These three areas: the philosophies of how machinic interactions have coalesced into one commonly accepted into a common form, a look at unexplored possibilities and under-emphasised potentials in the present, and a search for how to revive those alternative futures, each represent the three strands of artistic research in the project.

I have attempted to unify these into four project.


** TODO A Short Description of where we are at with computing.

** How we got to where we are today																		 :Edit:





	 My research has been into the technologi]cal ideologies that have shaped attitudes to the use of computers in music. Particularly the lineage of political strains Romantic Individualism and utopianism that beacame a part of the ethos of what is know as "The California Ideology"[fn:11] This fusion of various strains of thought among academics and inventors after World War Two would go on to shape many aspects of the design and research into the use of computers that we continue to use today.[fn:12]

Similarly to the cyberneticians, counterculturaliststs and techno-utopians, I wish to explore the interaction of sytems and tools and how the relate.

However in the field of music has at times been both highly influential, as Fred Turner argues that the use of rock music and stereo equipment as a 'mind expanding' tool was highly influential on the design of the computer.

However the notion of computer music has also offered a challenge for software designers to offer a satisfactory interface for,

it has also at times offered a challenge to the

It is my argument that aspects of thinking about how computers should be used in art and music are limited by ideological constraints on the kinds of interaction that can be permitted.

The lineage of the the 'california ideology' on interaction with computers today seems to enforce the idea of engagement witha  computer being focused on having one operator, holding tight deterministic control over one program utilising an acceptable set of input and output techniques.

However rather than attempting to completely divorce myself from this lineage or propose my own utopia. I wish to make a study of these forces of technoligical ideology and incorperate it into my artworks. By blending representations of the problematic lineage and present state of paranoia with other utopian visions of computing that never quite made it. As well as some of my own ideas about what might be possible in the realm of collaborative experience and new and experimental engagement with machines, others and ourselves. I hope to reintroduce political ideas into the discussion of technology by reintroducing the social and political into the musical and technological landscape.

I argue that there is a link between some aspects of the transhumanism which has influenced much of technological design and desires of transcendence in 20th century music compoers such as John Cage that has emphaised transcendce at he expese of 'silencing the social' in the wods of Douglas Kahn. It is not my wish to decry these works, rather to celebrate and reconsider them in the context of today where we are never sure if we are too connected and being surveilled, or too alone and alienated. Instead by seeking o re-empahises teh socaial, collaboratvie aspects of that is already there Instead by seeking o re-empahises teh socaial, collaboratvie aspects of that is already there.

As well as considering the ideaologies and politics that have informed the design of our 'tools', the works look at the ideas about appropriate aesthetics


as well as the aesthetics of the msucial landscape that those tools, their operators and composers help create.

It is my conjecture that in followng the history of early computing and developments in musical technolgy, we can see how the culture of three areas in western culture, military industrial and academic, became a key part of what I have termed 'contract culture' in the world after world war two.

The following works are a study in the relationship and possibilities in the spaces between communication technology and artistic practice.

One of the more interestng developments of the late 20th and early
21st century is the shift in the role of computing. Inititially
considered a tool limited to calculations and reckonings [fn:6], the
ability of computer to transmit and record has made it into a highly
effective communications tool. It is the tension between these two
roles, what I have started to think of as a tension between two different models for the organisation of information as outlined by De Landa..

between the signal and database, that I see exemplified in the contempory discourse about
surveilland and technology.[fn:5]

A computer can perform many roles, part of what makes general purpose machines interesting is their ability to be reconfigured. However that is not to say that the possibilities are limitless or easily explored. There are many things that are naturally difficult to do with general purpose computing for a wide variety of reasons that are too long to list. [fn:14] Furthermore, the manner in
which a product is designed, developed and organised, is often
specific to the workplace culture, organisation and mode of production
under which it originated. These kind of influences are likely to only
deepen rathr than disappear.[fn:15] A classic text describing this
scenario is the study by x..

Many of the functions of modern society depend upon the computer not as a caculator but as a communications tool to relay messages. However in practice, the processes that allow communication to take place, message packaging, routing, encryption, transmittion and error checking are all based on the computation of algorithms. Because of the hybrididy of modern communication, both computational and networked, I have chosen to study how modern communication and musical practice can be interrelated.

As this project, determined in looking at 'possibilities', has a somewhat futuristic bent. I have elected to be somewhat wary of the degree to whih I cast the future in the mod eof my own emplacement. This circular inevitablility of conditioning my works into a kind of 'future-present' is somewhat inescapable. However in an attempt to mitigate this I have tried to take inspiriations for my work from other 'failed utopias' as much as the one I currently reside in.

In looking to early expectations and the failed dreams or unexplored possibilities of early omputer history, particulary notions of socialist computing, artificial intellignece, cybernetic surveilland and hippie counterculture, along with the ideas of modernist music composer such as Xenakis, Berio and Stochausen, who all had similar utopian notions about the future of both society and their art.

A closer look at the terms involved part forms the basis for beginning this work.

Exploring some of their neglected meanings and history of terms and contrasting that with where the emphasis of specific definition lies today is a key part of the work. By looking at the complete history and meaning of terms, particularly alternate meanings, I feel we can begin to excavate other possibilities, possibilities that were always available but feel cut off from now.

For example, the word computer has a been on a historical journey from meaning a human being that makes calculations, to a device facilitation calculation. However even the interesting parts of that statement miss some of the socio-cultural aspects of what a being a computer means.

For instance that computers were once large teams of people used in warfare to calculate distances, supplies and give reckonings for artillery. Or that later computers became numerical analysts, a job that was generally gendered to be for women, and teams of women were given the task of managing early machine-based computers. (Hmm prob not necessary, incl. refs).

How to portray this rich and often conflicted history in a word is a difficult task. We see that  a key role for the artist can be excavating meaning. Looking that the meanings that have been applied over the years and following a common task in critical theory, asking why certain aspects have traditionally been ignore, or taken as a given. Because of this, to begin my process I have given in depth listings of the meaning of key terms for the suite of works.  A dictionary definition offer a reflection on the range of meaning and the suggest links to the history of what are seen as ‘modern’ terms. I am seeking to try and combine and undermine these terms to try and understand my own position.

Networked, experience, computational, aesthetics and surveillance.

Of these five terms the only term not given in the title of the study, ‘surveillance’ represents both the shadow of the other four terms and also what I suspect is the means to analyse and explore the possibilities of the other terms.
