The ambition is not to explore a theme or central concept. For this reason I have seen the work in terms more common to fine art  than music.

The inspiriation is taken from Serres concept of 'black boxing'. Seeing the world in terms of components. Taking one and stripping away layers of abstraction in order to understand the processes involved, then returning the 'box' to its position  with newfound understanding.

In my case I am looking at the current state of human relations as I experience them. I am particularly focussed on the 'machinic' qualities and the managemnt of what is commonly thought of as mediation, and common anxieties and concerns with current engagement. I am usingtools that seem applicable and the easiest and most relevant to the concerns. typically the same materials such as, web page scripting, electronic components and sensory inputs and outputs, that are involved in the 'black box'.

So while the work might seem at first technical in nature. I am more interested in trying to 'simply' understand a set of relations.
